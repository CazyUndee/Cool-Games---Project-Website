# My-Website

This is my website, it features me and my friends' projects, however, I am not a professional web developer and I am working on this site alone, so the website may not be the best and updates and sites might be in the coming soon phase for a long time. But I am still working on it, and I am always open to suggestions. If you would like to contribute, please feel free to do so.
